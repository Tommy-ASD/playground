If anyone happens to stumble across this; IT IS NOT ACCURATE
I am making this to try to understand how TCP works under the hood, and it may be completely wrong.

Source port: 59310 (binary, 2 bytes): 1110011110101110
Destination port: 80 (binary, 2 bytes): 0000000001010000
Sequence number: 0 (binary, 4 bytes): 00000000000000000000000000000000
